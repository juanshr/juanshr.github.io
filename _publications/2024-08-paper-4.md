A-type stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes. We perform 3D numerical simulations of a $$2 M_\odot$$
A-type star with a convective core of roughly $$20 \%$$
of the stellar radius surrounded by a radiative envelope using a star-in-a-box model, as a way to explore magnetic fields driven by convection in the core of the star. The non-ideal fully compressible magnetohydrodynamics equations were solved using the Pencil Code. Rotation periods from 8 to 20 days were explored. We conclude that the core is able to host strong hemispheric dynamos with cyclic behavior and typical magnetic field strengths around 60
kG. However, the magnetic fields that reach the surface are several orders of magnitude smaller than in the core, which is not enough to explain the observed magnetic fields.
