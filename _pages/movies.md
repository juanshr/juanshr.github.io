## Shaping core dynamos in A-type stars: The role of dipolar fossil fields
---
Several dipolar fossil field configurations are impossed in a $$2.2 M_\odot$$ A-type star hosting a core dynamo. <br />

### Radial magnetic field at the stellar surface $$B_r(R,\theta,\phi,t)$$.

- Surface magnetic fields in the cases where the dipole moment is aligned with the axis of rotation ($$\beta = 0^\circ$$)

- Horizontal cases, where the dipole is perpendicular to the axis of rotation ($$\beta = 90^\circ$$)

All the plots were clipped to $$\pm 5$$ kG.

### Meridional distribution of the azimuthally averaged magnetic fields of the aligned cases ($$\beta = 0^\circ$$)

The toroidal component is represented with the colormap, and the poloidal component with the arrows, where the width 
is proportional to the strength of the field. The $$\overline{B}_\phi$$ values of the enhanced cases (DipB and DipB*)
were clipped to $$\pm 80$$ kG, and $$\pm 60$$ kG in the unaffected cases (DipA), for a better visualization.
