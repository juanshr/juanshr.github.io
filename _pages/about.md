## About me

### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan Pablo Hidalgo, a Chilean astronomer ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±.

I obtained my BSc in Astronomy at the University of ConcepciÃ³n, Chile, in 2021. Subsequently, 
I continued my studies at the same institution and received my MSc in Astronomy in 2023

- Currently, I am a PhD candidate at Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, since November of 2024.

- My main research topic is related to the origin of the large-scale magnetic fields in early-type. I explore 
different scenarios that can lead to the formation and evolution of these magnetic fields, using 
fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and (semi)analytical estimations.

- I am also interested in the effect of magnetic fields on the habitability of exoplanets.
