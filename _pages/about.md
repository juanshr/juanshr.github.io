## Hi there!

I'm Juan Pablo Hidalgo, a Chilean astronomer ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±.

- PhD candidate at Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹.

- My main research topic is related to the origin of the large-scale magnetic fields in early-type. I explore 
different scenarios that can lead to the formation and evolution of these magnetic fields, using 
fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic simulations, and analytical estimations.

- I am also interested in the effect of magnetic fields on the habitability of exoplanets.

- Feel free to contact me via email, clicking [here](mailto:juanpablo.hidalgo@uniroma1.it)!
